# Hi. I'm Jolene.

I'm an archaeologist, but mostly the desk kind. I manage statewide archaeological site data for the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. We've got data on [44,000+ sites](http://opencontext.org/subjects/FA7B837E-7012-44CE-B017-71580CFFFF01) and I'm looking for new ways to use the information and present it to the public.

I've been interested in getting more technical experience to do cool things, but over the past year I've really immersed myself in learning. I've done a lot of Codecademy [tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/aejolene) and have also explored some great open web mapping tools. Some of this has been in support of my participation in the [Institute of Digital Archaeology Method and Practice](http://digitalarchaeology.msu.edu/), where I first met Dr. Graham in the physical world (i.e. beyond [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aejolene)). 

Right now I feel like I know a tiny bit about a lot of things. I'm collecting tools, but I don't have mastery of any of them yet. I want to dig deeper, but I'm also just playing around to see what sticks. This course is great because I can get a bit more support than I have when I'm completely self-directed. I do adore tutorials, but sometimes it's easy to give up on a hard skill if I don't have any accountability.

Ultimately I am hoping to collect what I've learned and teach others working with small heritage institutions about free or low-cost, open tools that they can use for digital storytelling in all its forms.
