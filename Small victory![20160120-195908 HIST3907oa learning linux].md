I had a frustrating day on Monday. I made so much progress, but got stuck trying to get [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to run on Linux. I kept running into errors that I didn't understand and I wasn't finding much help from googling. 

This is the frustrating part of the learning curve where I am full steam ahead when I realize I'm missing some fundamental piece of understanding. It's maddening.

I gave it a day. I swear I didn't do anything to my system. But when I tried again, it just worked. I won't look the gift horse in the mouth, I guess.

I'm losing momentum this evening, but I've got mkdocs rolling. Next step is to either add a site to my current github repository or create a new one. The first option would probably be worthwhile to figure out, but the second would be easier. We'll see how much patience I have tomorrow (if I can keep my tired hands off of this for the rest of the night).
